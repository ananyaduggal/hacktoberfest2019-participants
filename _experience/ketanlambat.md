Right from the time I got to know about the *Hacktober Fest* 🐱‍💻 event, I was very excited about it. With a team of highly skilled **\<coders/>** we got a club event registered in the Hacktoberfest website and made a website :computer: for the same. As :calendar: October kicked in, the Open Source contributions started the excitement for the same was in the air. The feeling of making others join this journey was indeed a great satisfaction :smiley:.

I am very delighted :blush: and thankful :pray: to Hacktoberfest and IOTA for providing me this opportunity to explore the world of Open Source :octocat: , with a nice reward :sunglasses: (Of Course) .

Cheers :v:
